## About this project and the author
CannonBoy was a personal project and its main goal was to have a publishable game created from scratch, with initial focus on iOS. The app was on the AppStore on 2015 and 2016, but it's not up anymore. But since Unity is awesome enough to port the project to multiple platforms, the web browser version can be found [here!](https://pedropmota.github.io/cannon-boy/) :)

The art, character design, source code and even the sound effects were developed/edited by me. As a Software Engineer/Developer, working on the artistic part (even for a small project) was definitely a very fun challenge!
