### About this project and the author
CannonBoy was one of those one-man projects and the main goal was to create a full and publishable game, mainly as a learning experience. The app was on the iOS AppStore on 2015 and 2016 and now, since Unity is awesome enough to port projects to multiple platforms, the WebGL version can be found [here!](https://pedropmota.github.io/cannon-boy/) :)

The art, character design, source code and even the sound effects were sketchet/developed/edited by me. As a Software Developer, working on the artistic part (even for a small project) was definitely a very fun challenge!
